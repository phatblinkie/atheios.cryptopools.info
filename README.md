## Open Source Mining Pool

### Building on Linux

Dependencies:

  * go >= 1.10
  * redis-server >= 2.8.0
  * nodejs >= 4 LTS
  * nginx
  * geth (multi-geth)

**I highly recommend to use Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.**

### Install go lang

    $ sudo apt-get install -y build-essential golang-1.10-go unzip
    $ sudo ln -s /usr/lib/go-1.10/bin/go /usr/local/bin/go

### Install redis-server

    $ sudo apt-get install redis-server

It is recommended to bind your DB address on 127.0.0.1 or on internal ip. Also, please set up the password for advanced security!!!

### Install nginx

    $ sudo apt-get install nginx

sample config located at configs/nginx.default.example (HINT, edit and move to /etc/nginx/sites-available/default)

### Install NODE

This will install the latest nodejs

    $ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | sudo -E bash -
    $ sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

### Install multi-geth

    $ wget https://github.com/ethereumsocial/multi-geth/releases/download/v1.8.10/multi-geth-linux-v1.8.10.zip
    $ unzip multi-geth-linux-v1.8.10.zip
    $ sudo mv geth /usr/local/bin/geth

### Install  Pool

    $ git clone https://github.com/phatblinkie/atheios.cryptopools.info.git
    $ cd atheios.cryptopools.info
    $ make all
    $ ls build/bin/

you should see open-callisto-pool binary there.

### Set up pool

presetup configs are in configs directory, edit to suit your needs

### Run the service installer
    edit the top of the "service_installer.sh"
//your user you plan to use for the coin, could be the coin name for instance
user="atheios"
//the name of the coin, used to make the services match the coins name
coin="atheios"
//the location of the config files if you moved them
config_dir="/home/$user/cryptopools.info-pools/configs"
//the default name of the built pool binary, it will rename it to atheios for you.
poolbinary="/home/$user/cryptopools.info-pools/build/bin/open-callisto-pool"

   when its edited, run with root user with ./service_installer.sh  or with sudo with sudo ./service_installer

(installing services requires root level access)


### Open Firewall

Firewall should be opened to operate this service. Whether Ubuntu firewall is basically opened or not, the firewall should be opened based on your situation.
You can open firewall by opening 80,443,8080,8888,8008.

## Install Frontend

### Modify configuration file

    $ nano atheios.cryptopools.info/www/config/environment.js

Make some modifications in these settings.

    APP: {
      // API host and port
      ApiUrl: '//atheios.cryptopools.info/',
      PoolName: 'ATHeios Pool',
      CompanyName: 'CryptoPools.info',
      // HTTP mining endpoint
      HttpHost: 'https://ATHeios.CryptoPools.info',
      HttpPort: 8882,

      // Stratum mining endpoint
      StratumHost: 'ATHeios.CryptoPools.info',
      StratumPort: 8002,

      // Fee and payout details
      PoolFee: '1.0%',
      PayoutThreshold: '1.0',
      PayoutInterval: '3h',

      // For network hashrate (change for your favourite fork)
      BlockTime: 22.0,
      BlockReward: 12,
      Unit: 'PIRL',

The frontend is a single-page Ember.js application that polls the pool API to render miner stats.

    $ cd atheios.cryptopools.info/www
    $ sudo npm install -g ember-cli@2.9.1
    $ sudo npm install -g bower
    $ sudo chown -R $USER:$GROUP ~/.npm
    $ sudo chown -R $USER:$GROUP ~/.config
    $ npm install
    $ bower install
    $ ./build.sh
    $ note: the build script copies the contents of atheios.cryptopools.info/www/dist/ to ~/www

As you can see above, the frontend of the pool homepage is created. Then, move to the directory, www, which services the file.

Set up nginx.
    $ a sample config file for nginx is include in the configs directory copy it or edit as directed below
    $ sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default

Modify based on configuration file.

    # Default server configuration
    # nginx example

    upstream api {
        server 127.0.0.1:8080;
    }

    server {
        listen 80 default_server;
        listen [::]:80 default_server;
        root /home/<your-user-name>/www;

        # Add index.php to the list if you are using PHP
        index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;

        server_name _;

        location / {
                # First attempt to serve request as file, then
                # as directory, then fall back to displaying a 404.
                try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
        }

        location /api {
                proxy_pass http://api;
        }

    }

After setting nginx is completed, run the command below.

    $ sudo service nginx restart

Type your homepage address or IP address on the web.
If you face screen without any issues, pool installation has completed.

### Extra) How To Secure the pool frontend with Let's Encrypt (https)

This guide was originally referred from [digitalocean - How To Secure Nginx with Let's Encrypt on Ubuntu 16.04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-secure-nginx-with-let-s-encrypt-on-ubuntu-16-04)

First, install the Certbot's Nginx package with apt-get

```
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install python-certbot-nginx
```

And then open your nginx setting file, make sure the server name is configured!

```
$ sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
. . .
server_name <your-pool-domain>;
. . .
```

Change the _ to your pool domain, and now you can obtain your auto-renewaled ssl certificate for free!

```
$ sudo certbot --nginx -d <your-pool-domain>
```

Now you can access your pool's frontend via https! Share your pool link!

### Notes

* Unlocking and payouts are sequential, 1st tx go, 2nd waiting for 1st to confirm and so on. You can disable that in code. Carefully read `docs/PAYOUTS.md`.
* Also, keep in mind that **unlocking and payouts will halt in case of backend or node RPC errors**. In that case check everything and restart.
* You must restart module if you see errors with the word *suspended*.
* Don't run payouts and unlocker modules as part of mining node. Create separate configs for both, launch independently and make sure you have a single instance of each module running.
* If `poolFeeAddress` is not specified all pool profit will remain on coinbase address. If it specified, make sure to periodically send some dust back required for payments.
* DO NOT OPEN YOUR RPC OR REDIS ON 0.0.0.0!!! It will eventually cause coin theft.
